("dotPH"), through their authorized representatives, and  takes effect on the date of execution by the final party (the  "Effective Date").</p>

    <p>Whereas, the Registrar's objective, through this Agreement, is to enhance its service offerings.</p>
    <p>Whereas, dotPH is a registry of sub-domains of the PH country code top  level domains, namely: .ph, .com.ph, .org.ph, .mil.ph and .net.ph (the  "Domain/s") and has established a Domain Registration Service (the  "Service") for accomplishing such registrations on the Internet;</p>
    <p>Whereas, by this Agreement, dotPH offers its Service to the Registrar,  including access to the dotPH Domain Server and to dotPH Confidential  Information to facilitate registration;</p>
    <p>Whereas, this Registrar service agreement ("Service Agreement" or  "Agreement") is submitted to dotPH Domains, INC.("dotPH") for the  purpose of applying for and registering sub-domains of the PH  country-code top level domain ("Domain") on the Internet.

By Registrar's use  of its Registrar Account following the effective date of any revision  of dotPH Policies, Registrar agrees to be bound by such revisions to  dotPH Policies. In the event Registrar does not wish to be bound by the  updated dotPH Policies, Registrar's sole remedy is to terminate its  Registrar Account and this Agreement by following the appropriate dotPH  Policies regarding such termination.</p>
